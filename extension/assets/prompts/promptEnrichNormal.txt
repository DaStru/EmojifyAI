Your task is to include suitable emojis into a given text.
Preserve formatting like line breaks. Ensure you leave a space after an inserted emoji if another word follows directly.

Here is an example for the expected structure for the output: 

Input Text: Alan Mathison Turing (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist.\n\nHe was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science.
